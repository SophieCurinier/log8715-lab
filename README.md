## Lab 1 - Implementation ECS
This is a circle simulation application implemented using an ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.
### Functionnality
The application provides the following features:
- Circles: The circles have different sizes represented by an integer value.
- Dynamics: Some circles are dynamic, meaning they have a velocity and move on the screen.
- Statics: Some circles are static and do not move. These circles represent obstacles.
- Collisions: When two circles collide, the following events occur:
  - Circles bounce off each other using the CalculateCollision method in the CollisionUtility utility class.
  - If the circles have different sizes, the larger circle's size increases by 1 and the smaller circle's size decreases by 1.
  - If the circles have the same size, their sizes remain unchanged.
  - A collision between a static circle and a dynamic circle does not affect their sizes. Only the dynamic circle bounces, while the static circle remains stationary.
- Destruction: When a circle reaches a size of 0, it is destroyed.
- Explosions: When a circle reaches a predefined explosion size specified in the configuration, it explodes into two smaller circles moving in opposite directions. The resulting circles have sizes half of the original circle's size.
- Border Collision: When a circle collides with the screen border, it bounces off.
- Interaction: The user can click on a dynamic circle to either make it explode into two circles if its size is 2 or greater, or make it disappear if its size is 0.
- Time Rewind: By pressing the spacebar, the simulation state rewinds by 3 seconds (frame precision) with a cooldown period of 3 seconds. The cooldown state is displayed in the editor console if the spacebar is pressed before the cooldown ends
- Circle Colors: Circles have colors that change based on their state:
  - Static circles are red.
  - Dynamic circles without collisions are blue.
  - Dynamic circles with collisions are green.
  - Dynamic circles that will reach their maximum size on the next collision with a smaller circle are orange.
  - A clicked dynamic circle turns pink.
- Protection Mechanism: Circles with a size equal to or smaller than a value defined in the configuration can become randomly protected. The protected size is always smaller than the explosion size. At each frame, a circle with a size below the protected size has a probability defined in the configuration to become protected. A protected circle cannot change its size. Smaller circles colliding with the protected circle do not change their size. Larger circles colliding with the protected circle decrease their size by 1. The protection state of a circle expires after a delay defined in the configuration. After being protected, a circle cannot become protected again until a cooldown defined in the configuration has elapsed.
